# Computer-Security-Final-Project-Authorization-Authenitcation-Hashing-with-Salts-Biba-BLP


TA is the main java file to run. This program allows you to create new users on a system where their passwords are salted and hashed and stored within a text file. It then allows you to log in to the system and depending on your clearance level lets you read and write certain text files according to BIBA or the BLP security models. If you want to test the program. Due to a time constraint It had to be hard coded in to only accept alice as a user when logging in. So to login you would use username alice and password alice123 if you wanted to demonstrate the security models.
